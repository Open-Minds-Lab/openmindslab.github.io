Welcome to the **Open Minds Lab**, a young and dynamic research lab at the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu). We aim to solve high-impact biomedical challenges leveraging our expertise in medical image analysis, signal processing, machine learning, biostatistics and data science. With a preference for cost-effective and clinically optimal solutions, we seek to improve patient outcomes with novel multidisciplinary techniques and decision support systems via quality, reproducible, and open science.
